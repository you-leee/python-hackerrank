# Brieâ€™s Drawing teacher asks her class to open their n-page book to page number p.
# Brie can either start turning pages from the front of the book (i.e., page number 1)
#   or from the back of the book (i.e., page number n),
#   and she always turns pages one-by-one (as opposed to skipping through multiple pages at once).
# When she opens the book, page is always on the right side:
# Given and n,p find and print the minimum number of pages Brie must turn in order to arrive at page p.
