# You are in-charge of the cake for the birthday and have decided the cake will have one candle for each year of her age.
# When she blows out the candles, sheâ€™ll only be able to blow out the tallest ones.
# Your task is to find out how many candles she can successfully blow out.

# For example, if your niece is turning 4 years old, and the cake will have candles of height 3, 2, 1, 3,
#   she will be able to blow out candles successfully, since the tallest candle is of height and there are such candles.
